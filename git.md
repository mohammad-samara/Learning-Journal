#Git
###Hi everyone. My name Is Mohammad Samara, and I will share with you what I have learned about **Git**

Git is a DVCS (Distributed Version Control system) that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots, it works locally on your pc to keep tracking your code and files changes. Also it will allow you to view,apply,and remove these changes.
    * Version Control is a system that allows you to see all the versions of a file by recording changes. with it you can go back to a previous version of the file, track modifications , and compare changes. By using a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can be reduced significintly.

## how it works?
* Each time you save a changed version of your project (called commit) Git creates a snapshot of the file at points of time, and it keeps a history of what these snapshots look like.
* Also it has a special label called **Head** which tell as that we are here (at a specific version of the file)
* git keep tracking all the changes of the file at different point of time.
* you usually give a snapshot a label called message describing why you did the changes.

## how to use it?
After installing Git on your computer you can access it's commands through *Ubuntu*
