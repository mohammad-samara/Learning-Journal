# HTML

### Hello my name is mohammad samara and I will share with you what I have learnt about HTML.

#### html is used to make a structure to the text of the web pages by using heading and subheading to make it easier to read.

### html uses elements to describe the structure of pages.

  * element is a 2 tags plus what is between them like this: " <p>text</p> "
  * element tells the browser information about the text between the two tags.
  * a tag is the combination of left-angle bracket,a character,and RIGHT -angle bracket like this "<a>"

**atributes** appear in the oppenig tag and tells us more about elements
**EX:** " <p lang="en-us"> "

## I will next explain the use of some of the attributes:

1. ID: to identify single element from the other element
2. class: to identify several element from the other element

## How to type a comment in the code that won't appear in the user's browser:

"<!-- your comment -->"
- it is used to make it easier to understand the code

## IFRAMES
- An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page â€” and in that window you can see another page. The term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame.
- One common use of iframes is to embed a Google Map into a page by typing the next code:
<iframe
width="450"
height="350"
src="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=moma+new+york
&amp;output=embed">
</iframe>
