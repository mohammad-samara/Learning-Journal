### Hi everyone. My name Is Mohammad Samara, and I will share with you what I have learned about **JavaScript**

##### Java Script

java script allows you to make web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content and markup used in web page while it is being viewed in the browser.

- you can use java script to select any element like h1 or any elements with a specific class attribute or Id attribute
- you can use java script to add elements, attributes,text, and images to the page, or remove them.
- you can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow, which allows it to access or change the content of the page.

**A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.**
*   scripts are made up of instructions a computer can follow step by step.

----------------------

### Expresions:
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions:
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE.
   * EX: var color = 'beige';
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE
    EX: var area = 3 * 2;


### OPERATORS:
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
- ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS: Assign a value to a variable (**=**)
- ARITHMETIC OPERATORS: Perform basic math (*,-,/,++,--,%)
- STRING OPERATORS Combine two strings (**+**)
- COMPARISON OPERATORS: Compare two values and return true or false
- LOGICAL OPERATORS: Combine expressions and return true or false


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### FUNCTION:

- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).

- To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the *curly bracec*, this is known as **function declaration**.

- Having declared the function, you can excute all of the of the statements between its curly bracec with just one line of code, this is known as **calling the function**


## getting a single value out of a function
some functions return information to the code that called them, by using the **return** keyword inside the function.
