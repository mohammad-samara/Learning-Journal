### Hi everyone. My name Is Mohammad Samara, and I will share with you what I have learned about **css**

- CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.

- CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.
css associates style rules with html elements. the rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed.


**a css cod** contains of two parts: **selectors** & **declaration**

  * the selector indicates which element the rule applies to.
  * the declaration indicates how element should be styled.
  * the declaration contains off two parts separated by a clone(:) sympol

     1. property: affects how elements are displayed, and indicates the aspects of the element yoy want to change.
     2. value: specifies the setting you want to use for the choosen property.

# how to apply styles from css to html:

- external file: there will be an external file for css rules with the extension .css that is separated from the html file and you can link it with the html file by typing the next code at the < head > in the html file:
< link rel="stylesheet" href= "the path of the css file">
- style tag at the < head > in the html file like this:
< style>css codes< /style>
- inline styling

# coloring in css

* The **color property** allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
  - rgb values: These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)
  - hex codes: These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80
  ![image of hex codes](https://htmlcolors.com/img/hex-color.jpg)
  - color names: There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan

**Background Color**: You can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify foreground colors: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
