### Hi everyone. My name Is Mohammad Samara, and at this site I will talk about **how computer works**
# Introduction :

## what makes a computer a computer?
a computer had to perform four different tasks :
1. take input
2. store information
3. process it
4. output the results.

- what *input* is the stuff that you do that makes the computer do stuff.
You can tell computers what to do with the keyboard, the mouse, the microphone, the camera, And a touchscreen.
All these different inputs give a computer information, which is then stored in memory.
A computer's processor takes information from memory.
It manipulates it or changes it using an algorithm, which is just a series of commands.
And then it sends the processed information back to be stored in memory again.
This continues until the processed information is ready to be output.
- How a computer outputs information depends on what the computer is designed to do.
A computer display can show text, photos, videos, or interactive games
The output of a computer may even include signals to control a robot.

Inside a computer are electric wires and circuits that carry all the information in a computer.
How do you store or represent information using electricity?
 if you have a single wire with electricity flowing through it, the signal could either be on or off.
With one wire, we can represent a yes or no, true or false, a one or zero, This on/off state of a single wire is called a bit, and it's the smallest piece of information a computer can store, if you use more wires you get more bits: more ones and zeros with more bits you can represent more complex information.
But to understand that, we need to learn about something called the binary number system.
In the binary number system, we only have two digits: zero and one.
With these two digits, we can count up to any number.
What's important is that any number can be represented with only ones and zeros,
or by a bunch of wires that are on or off.
But what about other types of information? Like text, images, or sound?
It turns out that all these things can also be represented with numbers.
- a number is assigned to each letter in the alphabet.
You can then represent any word or paragraph as a sequence of numbers.
And as we saw, these numbers can be stored as on or off electrical signals.
-  images are made out of teeny dots called pixels, and each pixel has a color.
Each of the colors can be represented with numbers.
A video is images shown in sequence very fast. -
-  sound is basically a series of vibrations in the air, which can be represented graphically as a waveform, and any point on this waveform can be represented by a number.

In order to process the information that comes in as input, and to make the information that is output, a computer needs to modify and combine the input signals.
To do this, a computer uses millions of teeny electronic components, which come together to form circuits.
Different electrical circuits can perform simple calculations like subtraction or multiplication.

# Input & Output :

There are input devices that take input from the outside world and convert it into binary information, there is memory to store this information, there's a central processing unit or CPU, where all the calculations are done. And,  there are output devices that take information and convert it into a physical output.
how input travels through a computer and becomes output.
When you press a key on your keyboard - let's say the letter "B". The keyboard converts the letter to a number.
That number is sent as binary, ones and zeros, into the computer.
Starting from this number, the CPU calculates how to display the letter "B" pixel by pixel.
The CPU requests step-by-step instructions from memory, which tell it how to draw the letter "B".
The CPU runs these instructions and stores the results as pixels in memory.
Finally, this pixel information is sent in binary to the screen.
The screen is an output device, which converts the binary signals into the tiny lights and colors that make up what you see.
No matter what it is you want to do with the computer, every single action is about:
inputting information from the physical world, storing and processing that information, and getting some output back into the physical world.

# software & hardware :

When you look inside a computing device you see a bunch of circuits, chips, wires,
speakers, plugs, and all sorts of other stuff.
This is the hardware, but what you don't see is the software.
Software is all of the computer programs, or code, running on this machine.
Software can be anything from apps and games to webpages. 

But how do the hardware and the software interact with one another?
The CPU is the master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer.
inside it has smaller, simpler parts that handle specific tasks.
It has circuits to do simple math and logic.
It has other circuits to send and receive information to and from different parts of the computer.
The CPU receives simple commands like "add" and "store" that tell it which circuit to use to do a specific job.
Just like numbers, all of these simple commands can be represented in binary ones and zeros or on and off electrical signals.
The binary commands are stored in memory and the CPU fetches and executes them in sequence one after the other.
This sequence of commands is a very simple computer program.

# operating system :

The operating system of the computer is the master program
that manages how software gets to use the hardware of the computer.
Inside every computer is an operating system managing software that controls the computer's hardware.
The software is a series of commands made of simple binary code,
and that binary code is just electrical signals flowing through billions of tiny circuits.
