### hello, my name is mohammad and I am here to to tell you about a software that every doder have in his computer which is called ''*Text Editor*''
### so what is text editor?
A text editor is any program that you can use to type and edit text, you can install it on your computer or access online through the web browser, and it is used to write codes such as HTML codes to create web sites, it could also support another programming laguages to build apps.

### how to choose a text editor?
there is a lot of text editors and everyone of them might have features that are not in the other, so there is no thing as the number one text editor, because coders chooses thier text editor depending on how they use it.
But there is some significant that will make it too easier to write codes and I recommend you to look for a text editor that have them all:

1. code completion: when you are typing a code, it will give you suggestions to complete the code based on what you have written, which will save time and reduce spelling errors.
    * some code complition might also include closing of brackets, tags, and quotation marks

2. syntax highlighting: which colors the words in code depending on its type (attributes,element...etc). words with the same type will be colored with the same color, and this will make it easier to read the code and finding errors.

3. a nice variety of themes: to reduce eyes fatigue.

4. the ability to choose from a alot of usefull extensions: when you become familiar with text editor and you want to customise it to make coding easier and faster you can add some extentions which is most like add-ons.

next ,I will give you some examples for text editors with some of thier features:
* Visual Studio Code: one of the best text editors, because it includes the following features: 
   * syntax highlighting
   * code completion
   * extensions
   * themes

* NotePad++:text editor for Windows Computers only, with the following features:
   * syntax highlighting
   * code comletion
       * word completion
       * function completion

### what is the difference between “basic” text editor ,coding-specific text editor and IDE?
- basic text editors don’t have many features as syntax highlighting ,code comletion ,extensions and themes.
so it will be harder to use it for coding and it won't help you finding errors.
- while coding-specific text editor have many features such as syntax highlighting ,code comletion ,extensions themes and more.
so it will be easier to to write codes and fix errors.
- IDE (Integrated Development Environment): is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software.
An everyday text editor is much more lightweight and flexible for biggeners.
